Install
----------

If you'd like to play zhpy3 with full features, you should install zhpy3.

You could use easy_install command to install or upgrade zhpy3::

    $ easy_install -U zhpy3

to use easy_install command, you should install distribute module for python 3 first:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute/

And check your system path params if it contains python3.x/bin path.

ex: edit .bashrc to include "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/bin" in your PATH parameter. 

What is Zhpy3
---------------

Zhpy3 is the successor of zhpy, to provide the python 3 language translator with fully tested chinese keywords, variables, and parameters support. Zhpy is INDEPENDENT on python 3 versions(3.x….).

The core of zhpy3 is a lightweight python module and a language
source convertor based on python3, which provides
command line tool to translate zhpy3 code to python 3.

See http://www.flickr.com/photos/gasolin/2064120327

You could invoke interpreter with 'twpy', 'cnpy' command instead of "python3" in command line to execute source code wrote in either Traditional/Simplified Chinese or English.

The framework is not hard to extend to another languages such as japenese or korean.
